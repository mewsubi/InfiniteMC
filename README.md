Immortalizing the Minecraft Dimensions 20w14infinite Snapshot

## Goals
After the release of Minecraft's 20w14infinite Snapshot on April 1st, 2020, I've been playing the snapshot non-stop with my friends. Together, we've enjoyed exploring hundreds of different, randomly generated dimensions, and we want to keep the features alive, updated, and available in all future versions. I've started this project with the learning objective of better understanding the Minecraft source code, and to serve as a reference for anyone else interested in doing the same.

### Obtaining the Minecraft .jar files
There are several ways to go about obtaining the .jar for the server & client:  

- One way is to go to <https://mcversions.net/> and find the server.jar and client.jar for the version you're interested in
- Another way is to go to the .minecraft folder (Windows), and go to /versions and find the .jar file based on the version. There will also be a .json file, which will contain a link to server.jar
